"""Tracks which src/api route modules are mounted on the application.

Eleven route modules under src/api are not imported by src/api/main.py, so the
endpoints they define are unreachable. Issues #1495 and #1497 through #1508
tracked exactly these files and were closed as completed while the modules
stayed unmounted, which is possible because nothing failed when they did.

This suite pins the current state. Adding a route module without mounting it,
or mounting one, fails here with instructions, so the decision is recorded
rather than discovered later.

# Auth state at the time of writing, which matters because mounting one is a
# single line and two of them would serve unauthenticated traffic:
#   no per-route auth : compliance (14), defense (14)
#   verify_api_key    : digital_twin (12), metaverse (15), nexus (11),
#                       research (10), simulation (9), supergraph (14)
#   require_role      : governance (15), knowledge (11), omega (7)
#   empty stub        : sso (0 routes)
#
# compliance and defense additionally fail to import. They use
# "from ..security import require_api_key", which resolves to src.security
# rather than src.api.security, so mounting one raises ImportError before it can
# serve anything. Those two are also the ones with no per-route auth, so the
# import should not be corrected without adding the missing dependencies.
