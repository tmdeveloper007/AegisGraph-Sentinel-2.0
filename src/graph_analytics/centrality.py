Graph Centrality Algorithms

Pure functions operating on a plain adjacency mapping, deliberately kept free of
any GraphStore dependency so they can be tested against hand-computed reference
graphs and reused by any caller holding a different graph representation.

Every measure returns values normalised to [0, 1] and keyed by node id, and every
function tolerates empty graphs, isolated nodes, self-loops and graphs split into
disconnected components.
